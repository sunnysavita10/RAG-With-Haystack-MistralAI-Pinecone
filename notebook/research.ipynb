      "For open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These\n",
      "answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\n",
      "annotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\n",

      "the model with each (q,a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\n",
      "there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\n",
      "such as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\n",
      "in top 1000 documents for the query.\n",
      "CuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\n",
      "sions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\n",
      "To overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\n",
      "each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\n",
      "target. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\n",
      "each regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\n",
      "TriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\n",
      "ment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\n",
      "compehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [ 26], which are\n",
      "consistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\n",
      "TriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\n",
      "instead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\n",
      "appendix of [ 14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\n",
      "We ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\n",
      "conventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\n",
      "simpler to answer from Wikipedia.\n",
      "E Further Details on FEVER\n",
      "For FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\n",
      "then classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\n",
      "documents to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\n",
      "ﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\n",
      "we explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\n",
      "as evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\n",
      "us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\n",
      "F Null Document Probabilities\n",
      "We experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [ 20] in order\n",
      "to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if kdocuments\n",
      "were retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\n",
      "document, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\n",
      "logit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\n",
      "(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\n",
      "the interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\n",
      "cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\n",
      "documents for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\n",
      "mechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\n",
